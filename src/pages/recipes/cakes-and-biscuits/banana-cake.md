title: "Banana Cake"
image: ./banana-cake.jpg
ingredients:
  - 125 gram butter, softened
  - 1/2 cup (110g) brown sugar
  - 1/2 cup (110g) caster sugar
  - 2 eggs
  - 3 (280g) bananas, mashed
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 1 1/2 cup (225g) wholemeal self-raising flour
  - 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
  - pinch of salt
  - 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
  - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 3 tablespoon tablespoons milk
  - icing sugar, to dust
  - 1/4 cup (55g) caster sugar to glaze
  - 1 cup boiling water
directions:
  - Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan-forced). Grease and line a 22cm cake tin. A loaf cake tin also works really well.
  - Beat the butter and sugars until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until just combined. Add the mashed banana and vanilla, and mix until combined.
  - Sift the flour, bicarbonate soda, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon together. Stir through with the milk until well combined and the mixture attains a dropping consistency.
  - Spoon the cake batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top. Bake for 40 mins or until well risen and coming away from the sides of the tin. Test with a skewer; the skewer should come out clean.
  - Just before the cake is ready to remove from the oven, dissolve the 1/4 cup caster sugar in the boiling water to create the sugar glaze.
  - Remove the cake from the oven and baste generously with the sugar glaze. Stand for 5 minutes in the tin before turning it onto a wire rack to cool down completely.
  - If you’re feeling particularly sweet-toothed, dust the cake with icing sugar before serve.
servingSuggestion: "Best served on its own and soaked up with some fresh, buttered crusty bread. Alternatively, keep the potatoes separate and mash them as a side dish instead."

Quite possibly the best banana cake recipe I’ve come across (sorry Mum!). And with a couple of little tweaks, it’s become a staple in our house when there are over-ripe bananas lying around.
