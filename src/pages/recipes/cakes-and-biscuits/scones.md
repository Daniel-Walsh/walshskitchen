  - item|½ tsp salt
  - item|1 cup pouring cream
  - item|375ml-400ml (or 1½ cups) milk

directions:
  - Preheat fan-forced oven to 230°C. Lightly grease large flat oven tray.
  - Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add cream and 375ml milk. Use a flat-bladed knife to stir to a soft dough adding more milk if necessary. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently until dough comes together.
  - Press dough out to 2cm-thick. Using a 5.5cm round scone cutter, cut as many scones from dough as possible. Press dough scraps together gently, rolling it 2.5cm-thick and cut more scones. Repeat rolling the dough 5mm thicker each time until you have used all the dough. Place onto tray just touching each other.
