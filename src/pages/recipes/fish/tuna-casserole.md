title: "Tuna Casserole"
image: ../../../images/recipes/tuna-casserole.jpg
ingredients:
  - 425g tin of tuna in oil, drained
  - 400g dry spiral pasta
  - 1 large brown onion, finely chopped
  - 100g butter
  - 3/4 cup flour
  - 4–5 cups hot water
  - 2 Massel Ultrastock cubes, chicken
  - 2 tbsp tomato paste
  - 1 cup frozen peas
  - 1 tsp sugar
  - 2 tbsp curry powder
  - 1/4 tsp ground pepper
  - 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
  - 1/2 tsp ground paprika
  - 200g tasty cheese, grated
  - 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
directions:
  - Set a large pot of water on the stove to boil. Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees (180 for fan forced).
  - Add the onions and butter to a large pot and cook over a medium flame until the onions are golden and soft. Add the flour and combine until a soft dough forms.
  - Gradually add the hot water, stirring continuously with a whisk. Continue until all of the water has been added and a medium-thick roux (basic white sauce) forms. Add more water if required.
  - Add the tomato paste, peas, stock cubes, sugar, curry powder, cayenne pepper and ground pepper, stirring to combine. Add the tuna and stir through, breaking up the larger chunks with the whisk.
  - Add the pasta to the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked. Drain and set aside.
  - In a large baking tray, combine the pasta and the tuna mixture. In a separate bowl, combine the grated cheese and breadcrumbs, then sprinkle over the casserole evenly. Shake the paprika over the top evenly.
  - Bake in the oven for 20–30 minutes or until the top is golden and crunchy.

A very “more-ish” comfort dish, tuna casserole is perfect on cold winter nights.
