title: "Tuna Casserole"
image: ./tuna-casserole.jpg
ingredients:
  - item|425g tin of tuna in oil, drained
  - item|400g dry spiral pasta
  - item|1 large brown onion, finely chopped
  - item|100g butter
  - item|3/4 cup flour
  - item|4–5 cups hot water
  - item|2 Massel Ultrastock cubes, chicken
  - item|2 tbsp tomato paste
  - item|2 tbsp curry powder
  - item|1/4 tsp ground pepper
  - item|1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
  - item|1/2 tsp ground paprika
  - item|200g tasty cheese, grated
  - item|1/2 cup breadcrumbs
directions:
  - Set a large pot of water on the stove to boil. Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees (180 for fan forced).
  - Add the onions and butter to a large pot and cook over a medium flame until the onions are golden and soft. Add the flour and combine until a soft dough forms.
  - Gradually add the hot water, stirring continuously with a whisk. Continue until all of the water has been added and a medium-thick roux (basic white sauce) forms. Add more water if required.
  - Add the tomato paste, stock cubes, curry powder, cayenne pepper and ground pepper, stirring to combine. Add the tuna and stir through, breaking up the larger chunks with the whisk.
  - Add the pasta to the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked. Drain and set aside.
  - In a large baking tray, combine the pasta and the tuna mixture. In a separate bowl, combine the grated cheese and breadcrumbs, then sprinkle over the casserole evenly. Shake the paprika over the top evenly.
  - Bake in the oven for 20–30 minutes or until the top is golden and crunchy.
servingSuggestion: For a healthier low-carb/high-protien alternative, replace the pasta with red lentil pasta, the flour with wholemeal flour, and the breadcrumbs with polenta.
