image: ./baileys-chocolate-truffles.jpg
ingredients:
  - item|90g butter
  - item|1/2 cup thickened cream
  - item|300g dark chocolate, chopped (at least 70% cocoa solids)
  - item|2-4 tbsp Baileys Irish Cream
directions:
  - Place butter and cream in a small pan. Heat until butter melts and mixture boils.
  - Add chocolate. Stir over low heat until melted. Cool, then stir in Baileys Irish Cream. Transfer mixture to a bowl.
  - Cool in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally. When firm enough to handle, form teaspoons of mixture into uneven balls.
  - Sift some cocoa onto greaseproof paper. Roll each truffle in the cocoa until they are all generously coated. Refrigerate until firm. Store in an airtight container.
  - Truffles keep for about 2 weeks in the refrigerator and about 6 weeks if frozen.
  - "(Variation) White Truffles: as for Truffles but replace dark chocolate with white chocolate. The Baileys Irish Cream can be replaced with Tia Maria. Coat white truffles in coconut instead of cocoa."
