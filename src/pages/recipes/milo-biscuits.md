image: ../../images/recipes/milo-biscuits.jpg
ingredients:
  - 125 g butter
  - 1 cup caster sugar
  - 1 1/2 cups self-raising flour, sifted
  - 3/4 cup Milo
  - 1 egg, beaten
directions:
  - Cream butter and sugar together.
  - Add egg and the Milo, then the flour.
  - (Optional) Wrap dough in cling wrap and chill it in the fridge for 30â€“60 minutes. This prevents the cookies from spreading too much during baking.
  - Roll into balls and flatten slightly with back of fork before baking. Biscuits will spread quite a lot so ensure space between each or make smaller ones. Place on trays lined with baking paper.
  - Bake at 180C for 15 minutes.
servingSuggestion: "Hot, straight out of the oven!"
