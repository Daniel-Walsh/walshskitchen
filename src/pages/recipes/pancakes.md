image: ../../images/recipes/pancakes.jpg
ingredients:
  - 2 cups self-raising flour
  - 1/3 cup sugar
  - Pinch of salt
  - 1 3/4 cups milk
  - 2 eggs, separated
directions:
  - Combine all dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
  - In a separate mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and then add the milk. Once combined, add the mixture into the dry ingredients and mix well with a whisk.
  - Beat the egg whites with an electric beater until stiff white peaks form, then fold the whites into the batter.
  - Heat a frying pan to a warm temperature (less than half) and melt a small amount of butter to grease the pan. Pour small amounts of the batter into the pan and fry until bubbles rise to the tops, then flip over and cook until golden brown.
servingSuggestion: "Serve with ice-cream and maple syrup. And sprinkles. And chocolate topping. And fresh cut strawberries. And sliced banana. You get the idea."
