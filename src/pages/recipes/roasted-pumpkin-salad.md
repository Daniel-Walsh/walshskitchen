image: ../../images/recipes/roasted-pumpkin-salad.jpg
ingredients:
  - 1.75kg butternut pumpkin, descended, cut into 2cm thick pieces
  - Olive oil cooking spray
  - 1/2 cup pine nuts
  - 200g baby spinach
  - 1/4 cup honey
  - 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
directions:
  - Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Line two baking trays with baking paper. Place pumpkin in a single layer on trays. Spray with oil and turn to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Roast pumpkin, turning once, for twenty minutes or until golden and tender. Set aside to cool to room temperature.
  - Meanwhile, heat a small, non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add pine nuts. Cook, stirring, for three minutes or until golden.
  - "Make honey and balsamic dressing: Combine honey, vinegar and oil in a screw-top jar. Secure lid and shake to combine. Remove lid. Microwave on high (100%) for ten seconds or until honey is melted. Replace lid. Shake until well combined."
  - Place spinach and pumpkin in a large bowl. Sprinkle with pine nuts. Drizzle with dressing. Season with salt and pepper. Serve.
servingSuggestion: "Serve with ice-cream and maple syrup. And sprinkles. And chocolate topping. And fresh cut strawberries. And sliced banana. You get the idea."
