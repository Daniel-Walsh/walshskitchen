  - 2 tbsp white vinegar
  - 2–3 tbsp Gravox traditional powder
  - 2 tbsp vegetable oil
directions:
  - In a large pot, add the onion and vegetable oil and cook until the onions are soft and translucent. Add the beef mince and cook until browned, breaking it up at you go.
  - Add the curry powder, mustard powder tomato sauce, white vinegar and Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine.
  - Add the carrots, potatoes and beef stock cubes. Add enough water to cover everything. Simmer over a low-medium flame for 30–40 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft and cooked through.
  - Add Gravox powder and stir through. Continue adding more powder until sauce has thickened to the desired consistency. Add salt, pepper and more of any previously used ingredient to taste.
