ingredients:
  - item|50g soft pitted dates
  - item|2 unripe bananas
  - item|75g coconut oil, melted
  - item|100g rolled oats
  - item|100g ground almonds / almond meal
  - item|50g dried cranberries
  - item|30g cashews, chopped
directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/Gas 6. Grease and line a 20cm square baking tin with baking paper.
  - Simmer the dates in 100ml water in a small pan for around 10 minutes, or until they have softened and most of the water has evaporated.
  - Blitz them with the bananas in a food processor or with a hand-held blender until you have a smoothish paste. Transfer it to a bowl and stir in the melted coconut oil. Add the oats, almonds, cranberries and cashews and mix well.
  - Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, pressing it down into the corners and levelling the top with the back of a spoon.
  - Bake it for 20-22 minutes, or until the top is lightly golden. Cut it into bars while it is still warm and leave it to cool for 10 minutes. Remove the bars from the tin and store them in an airtight container for up to 5 days, or in the freezer.
servingSuggestion: "Any dried fruit works well in this recipe. You can also substitute the cashews with chopped hazelnuts or walnuts."
