image: ../../images/recipes/roti-bread.jpg
ingredients:
  - flour|280g plain flour
  - water|150g tepid water
  - sugar|10g caster sugar
  - 10g ghee
  - 150ml melted ghee, for folding and cooking
directions:
  - Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan-forced). Grease and line a 22cm cake tin. A loaf cake tin also works really well.
  - Beat the butter and sugars until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until just combined. Add the mashed banana and vanilla, and mix until combined.
  - Sift the flour, bicarbonate soda, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon together. Stir through with the milk until well combined and the mixture attains a dropping consistency.
  - Spoon the cake batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top. Bake for 40 mins or until well risen and coming away from the sides of the tin. Test with a skewer; the skewer should come out clean.
  - Just before the cake is ready to remove from the oven, dissolve the 1/4 cup caster sugar in the boiling water to create the sugar glaze.
  - Remove the cake from the oven and baste generously with the sugar glaze. Stand for 5 minutes in the tin before turning it onto a wire rack to cool down completely.
  - If you’re feeling particularly sweet-toothed, dust the cake with icing sugar before serve.
