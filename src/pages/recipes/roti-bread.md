title: "Roti Bread"
image: ../../images/recipes/roti-bread.jpgasdsa
ingredients:
  - flour|280g plain flour
  - water|150g tepid water
  - sugar|10g caster sugar
  - ghee|10g ghee
  - ghee|150ml melted ghee, for folding and cooking
directions:
  - Place ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix for three minutes.
  - Divide into roughly 100g balls, oil each one well and roughly flatten between two pieces of baking paper. Set aside on the bench to rest for 15 minutes.
  - Grase a clean benchtop space of 60cm x 60cm, with melted ghee. Working with one portion at a time, place dough into the centre of the greased area and massage it with the palm of your hand in a circular motion while pressing down and outwards.
  - Once it's as flat as possible, carefully hold the edges and stretch the dough outwards until it is tissue-thin all over. Drizzle with two teaspoons of melted ghee.
  - Perform a letter foldâ€”fold one edge in towards the centre, drizzle with melted ghee, then fold the opposite edge over to make a rough square with three layers. Flatter out as thinly as possible then set aside and repeat with remaining portions.
  - Heat a medium non-stock frying-pan over a medium heat with 1tsp ghee. Cook the roti, turning once the underside is very crispy and golden brown. Remove from the pan, season with salt and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Cook remaining roti.
