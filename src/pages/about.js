        <p>
          Way back when, I was originally going to write a family recipe cook
          book, but creating a family recipe{" "}
          <span className="font-italic">website</span> is so much easier than
          publishing a physical book.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The recipes enshrined here are a collection of some of our familyâ€™s{" "}
          <span className="text-primary font-italic">happiest moments</span>{" "}
          shared around the dinner table. Some are "Walsh Originals" while
          others are favourites that have been clipped from magazines and
          websites and adopted into our regular meal rotations.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This is for my amazing, crazy, loving family&mdash;whom none of which
          have any idea why a weirdo with food issues like me would want to
          write a book about food.
