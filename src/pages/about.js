          <p>To my dear family,</p>
          <p className="mt-10">
            Way back when, I was originally going to write a family recipe cook
            book, but creating a family recipe{" "}
            <span className="underline">website</span> is so much easier than
            publishing a physical book.
          </p>
          <p>
            The recipes enshrined here are a collection of some of our familyâ€™s{" "}
            <span className="text-primary">happiest moments</span> shared around
            the dinner table. Some are "Walsh Originals" while others are
            favourites that have been clipped from magazines and websites and
            adopted into our regular meal rotations.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is for my amazing, crazy, loving family&mdash;whom none of
            which have any idea why a weirdo with food issues like me would want
            to write a book about food.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10">I love you all.</p>
          <p>&mdash; Dan</p>
