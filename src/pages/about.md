To my dear family,

<p class="mt-10">Way back when, I was originally going to write a family recipe cook book, but creating a family recipe <u>website</u> is so much easier than publishing a physical book.</p>

<p class="mt-6">The recipes enshrined here are a collection of some of our familyâ€™s <span class="text-primary">happiest moments</span> shared around the dinner table. Some are "Walsh Originals" while others are favourites that have been clipped from magazines and websites and adopted into our regular meal rotations.</p>

<p class="mt-6">This is for my amazing, crazy, loving family&mdash;whom none of which have any idea why a weirdo with food issues like me would want to write a book about food.</p>

<p class="mt-10">I love you all.</p>

&mdash; Dan
